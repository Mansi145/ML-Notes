## Linear Regression 
### Best fit data preparation - 
1) Linear assumption: Assume the data is linear and will give best prediction.
2) Remove collinearity: Means lines are modeled by the same line. Remove this. 
3) Gaussian (normal) distribution
4) Rescale data: Normalize it for normal distribution.
5) Remove noise: Remove Outliers 

### Best error function/cost factor - _RMSE_

**Left to read - How to remove collinearity and outliers to remove noise.**

- _Two types of algorithms- Parametric & Non-parametric_

## Classical ML vs Deep Learning
### Deep learning advantages:

1) Suitable for high complexity problems
2) Better accuracy, compared to classical ML
3) Better support for big data
4) Complex features can be learned

### Deep learning disadvantages:

1) Difficult to explain trained data
2) Require significant computational power

### Classical ML advantages:

1) More suitable for small data
2) Easier to interpret outcomes
3) Cheaper to perform
4) Can run on low-end machines
5) Does not require large computational power

### Classical ML disadvantages:

1) Difficult to learn large datasets
2) Require feature engineering
3) Difficult to learn complex functions
